      "text": "post-break updates / \n\n- my advisor sarah noted that the work carries an element of nostalgia, even though it is not explicitly framed that way\n\n- she connected this to how computers once behaved — slower, more legible, and more materially present\n\n- she suggested the project may sit between past and future, referencing older modes of computing while also imagining a time when computers no longer exist in their current form\n\n- this framing clarified that nostalgia here is not only about memory, but about questioning dominant trajectories of computing and what has been optimized away\n\n- while nostalgia is not a stated goal, it continues to surface through material choices, interaction pacing, and the object’s quiet presence\n\n-------------------------\n\n- meghna recommended the chapter “what is a computer?” from artificial intelligence by richard urwin. this was suggested in relation to my effort to redefine what a computer can be outside of productivity, speed, and command-based interaction. i plan to read this alongside my existing references to further ground the project’s conceptual framing.",
